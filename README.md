## Overview of the analysis:
Provide potential stakeholders a deep analysus of bike trip details. 

## Results: 
Manhatten is a popular starting location due to the proximity to both work and entertainment districts. The high density of the city lends itself to a bike-share problem like CitiBike.

The CitiBike bike-sharing program seems to be a huge success. With numbers like these, I can see why investors are looking to replicate Des Mones' success.

Riders check out the most number of bikes for 4-6 hours.

Female riders tend to keep their bikes checked out longer, and this may indicate they are being used more for transit to and from work.

On weekends the number of trips per day is spread out much more evenly across the day. On Weekdays we see more trips during regular commute hours.

The below graphs shows that women ride less during all times of the day.

Subscribership is heavily skewed towards male riders. CitiBike must do more to attract female subscribers.

## Summary: 
The NYC CitiBike program has a strong ridership that appears robust in both the long-term subscriber and the tourism market. 

Before the stakeholders invest, it would be essential to understand more about the ride profiles. I would suggest a more in-depth analysis of the use of the bikes. For example, are users using them to ride between mass transit and their offices? I would also want to start pulling in Data from Des Moines to understand if the ride profiles are similar? Are the offices and entertainment districts laid out in a manner that would lend itself to biking? Next, I would look into how friendly the roads are for bikers? Are there more accidents? Are there similar bike-friendly roads and trails?
